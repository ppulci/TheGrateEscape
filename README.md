# ðŸ§€ The Grate Escape

**The Grate Escape** is a vertical arcade platformer where you play as a piece of cheese fighting to escape the inside of a cheese grater.

Built in Unity with C# and featuring original artwork and a custom soundtrack, this project was completed just before I began my undergraduate degree in Computer Science â€” back when I was still working my high school retail job.
